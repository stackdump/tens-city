# tens.city — Tent City Ethos

## 1. Ethos: tent city
- Not skyscrapers; actual encampments.
- Anyone can stake a corner — no permission required.
- Minimal structure that belongs to you — dignity-through-shelter even when janky.
- No HOA, no governance tokens: just a tarp and a hook to keep your stuff dry.

## 2. Basic shelter (software terms)
The "lean-to of sticks" is the absolute minimum runtime that lets something simply live.

Concrete guarantees:
- Each person/object gets a directory.
- The directory is static (only files).
- It is addressable (stable URL / CID).
- Served straight off disk — no app server trying to own content.

Maps to:
- Filesystem-based
- Static web hosting
- The city is literally a filesystem tree

## 3. Principles (short)
- Provide stable, non-transient spots.
- Keep the runtime minimal and non-opinionated.
- Serve static files directly from disk with a generic viewer.
