# The Perfect Cup of Coffee ☕

Great coffee isn't about expensive equipment—it's about understanding the fundamentals.

## The Golden Ratio

Start with the basics:

- **Coffee**: 1 gram per 15-17 grams of water
- For a standard cup (240ml): ~15g of coffee
- Adjust to taste

## Water Matters

Your coffee is 98% water. Use:

- **Filtered water** when possible
- **Temperature**: 195-205°F (90-96°C)
- Avoid distilled water (tastes flat)

## Grind Size Guide

| Method | Grind Size | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Espresso | Extra Fine | Like flour |
| AeroPress | Fine | Like table salt |
| Pour Over | Medium | Like sand |
| French Press | Coarse | Like sea salt |
| Cold Brew | Extra Coarse | Like peppercorns |

## Brewing Methods

### French Press

Simple and forgiving:

1. Add coarse coffee to press
2. Pour hot water (just off boil)
3. Stir gently
4. Place lid, wait 4 minutes
5. Plunge slowly and serve

**Pros**: Full body, simple, no filters needed
**Cons**: Some sediment, less clean

### Pour Over

For clarity and control:

1. Place filter in dripper
2. Rinse filter with hot water
3. Add medium-ground coffee
4. Bloom: Pour 2x coffee weight in water, wait 30s
5. Pour in slow circles, total time 3-4 minutes

**Pros**: Clean, bright, controlled
**Cons**: Requires technique, slower

### AeroPress

The versatile champion:

1. Insert filter, rinse
2. Add fine coffee
3. Pour water (175-185°F for regular, 200°F for inverted)
4. Stir 10 seconds
5. Wait 1-2 minutes
6. Press slowly (30 seconds)

**Pros**: Versatile, quick, low acidity
**Cons**: Small batches only

## Coffee Selection

### Roast Levels

- **Light**: Bright, acidic, fruity notes
- **Medium**: Balanced, sweeter
- **Dark**: Bold, bitter, chocolatey

### Fresh is Everything

Coffee degrades quickly:

- **Best**: Within 2 weeks of roasting
- **Good**: Within 1 month
- **Stale**: After 2 months

Store in an airtight container away from light and heat.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Using Boiling Water

Water that's too hot extracts bitter compounds. Let it cool for 30 seconds after boiling.

### ❌ Wrong Grind Size

Too fine = bitter and over-extracted
Too coarse = weak and sour

### ❌ Dirty Equipment

Coffee oils go rancid. Clean your equipment weekly.

### ❌ Pre-Ground Coffee

Coffee starts losing flavor within 15 minutes of grinding. Invest in a burr grinder.

## Advanced Tips

### Water Chemistry

For the nerds:

- **Total Dissolved Solids**: 75-250 ppm
- **Calcium hardness**: 1-5 grains
- **Alkalinity**: 40 ppm or less

### Bloom Phase

The first pour releases CO2:

1. Pour 2x the coffee weight in water
2. Wait 30-45 seconds
3. Coffee should "bloom" and bubble
4. Continue with main pour

### Temperature Surfing

Different temperatures extract different flavors:

- **185-195°F**: Sweeter, less acidic
- **195-205°F**: Balanced
- **205°F+**: More body, more bitter

## My Daily Recipe

**Equipment**: AeroPress (inverted method)
**Coffee**: 17g medium-fine grind
**Water**: 250g at 185°F
**Time**: 2:30 total

1. Invert AeroPress, add coffee
2. Pour all water, stir 10 times
3. Cap with rinsed filter
4. Wait 2 minutes
5. Flip and press for 30 seconds
6. Enjoy!

## The Bottom Line

Great coffee comes from:

1. **Fresh beans** (2-3 weeks from roast)
2. **Proper grind** (right size, burr grinder)
3. **Good water** (filtered, right temperature)
4. **Correct ratio** (1:15 to 1:17)
5. **Clean equipment** (no old oils)

Start simple, experiment, and find what you love. There's no "perfect" cup—only the one perfect for you.
