# Welcome to Tens City 🏕️

Welcome to **Tens City** — a minimalist blog platform that embraces simplicity and content ownership.

## What Makes Tens City Different?

Instead of complex databases and authentication systems, Tens City takes a different approach:

- **Markdown-first**: Write your posts in simple, portable markdown files
- **Content-addressable**: Every post is uniquely identified by its content
- **Static by nature**: Fast, secure, and simple to deploy
- **Schema.org ready**: Automatic structured data generation for SEO

## The Tent City Philosophy

Think of it as a tent city rather than skyscrapers:

- Anyone can stake a corner — no permission required
- Minimal structure that belongs to you
- No complex governance — just simple, honest shelter for your ideas
- Your content lives in files you control

## Get Started
