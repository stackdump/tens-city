# Draft Article - Work in Progress

This is a draft article. It should be accessible when visiting the slug directly at `/posts/draft-article`, but it should NOT appear in:

- The `/posts` list
- RSS feeds
- Sitemap
- Search results
- Tag pages

This allows authors to share draft URLs for review without publishing them publicly.
